 SECTION I: Algorithm.
 1. A logistic
  company plan to rent a large amount of empty container.
 + Your task is to
  design an algorithm to help logistic company able to rent enough containers
  at the lowest price.
 + Case 1: 
 - Input: 
 const neededContainer = 3;

  const listings = [
 {
 name: "Container renter A",
 container: 1,

  totalCost: 1,
 },
 {
 name: "Container renter B",
 container: 2,

  totalCost: 1,
 },
 {
 name: "Container renter C",
 container: 3,

  totalCost: 3,
 },
 ];
 - Output: 
 [Contract with] Container renter B 2
  container, price: 1
 [Contract with] Container renter A 1 container, price:
  1
 [Summary] total cost 2
 - Explain: The optimal price is to rent 1
  container from renter A and 2 containers from renter B, the total cost of
  them is 2. (Same total cost but different provider is accepted)

 + Case
  2:
 - Input: 
 const neededContainer = 10;
 const listings = [
 {

  name: "Container renter A",
 container: 5,
 totalCost: 5,
 },
 {
 name:
  "Container renter B",
 container: 2,
 totalCost: 10,
 },
 {
 name:
  "Container renter C",
 container: 2,
 totalCost: 3,
 },
 ];
 -
  Output:
 [Contract with] Container renter A 5 container, price: 5

  [Contract with] Container renter C 2 container, price: 3
 [Contract with]
  Container renter B 2 container, price: 10
 Not enough containers

  [Summary] total cost 18
 - Explain: Display "not enough containers" if
  don't have enough container providers.
 + Case 3:
 - Input:
 const
  neededContainer = 10;
 const listings = [
 {
 name: "Container renter
  A",
 container: 5,
 totalCost: 5,
 },
 {
 name: "Container renter B",

  container: 2,
 totalCost: 10,
 },
 {
 name: "Container renter C",

  container: 10,
 totalCost: 3,
 },
 ];
 - Output:
 [Contract with]
  Container renter C 10 container, price: 3
 [Summary] total cost 3
 
 CASE
  STUDY: We are planning to build a backend for an e-commercial platform, your
  task is doing from system design, implementation to deploy production.

  SECTION I:
 1. Design UML for the backend of these features based on best
  practices to ensure scalable, easy coding.
 + Customer:
 - Can storage
  personal information (name, address, email, phone number, gender, etc...),
  cart, transaction, billing.
 + Agency:
 - Can storage personal information
  (name, address, email, phone number, gender, etc...), product, transaction,
  billing.
 + Admin:
 - Can read/create/update/delete agency.

 SECTION
  II:
 1. With UML you have already designed on question 1, what database are
  you using to implement?
 2. Why are you using that? What is the strong and
  weak point of it?
 3. Write docker-compose.yml to start the database
  locally.
 4. Setup Loopback 4
 5. Using UML on question 1, set up API for
  these features.

 SECTION II:
 1. Write sequence diagram to build a
  solution for authentication and authorize adapt the list of features
  below.
 + Customer:
 - Can login, logout.
 - Read transaction, billing
  linked with product.
 - Read agency information.
 + Agency:
 - Agency can
  read/create/update/delete of owner product.
 - Agency can read transaction,
  billing of owner.
 + Admin: 
 - Read billing, transaction linked product,
  customer, agency.
 + Common:
 - User can store auth state after reopen
  browser.
 2. Using solution on question 1, implements loopback4 for these
  features.
 3. What's the strong and weak point of your solution? How to
  improve that?
 4. Write sequence diagram to build a solution for testing,
  ensure correct permission scalable from 100 APIs to 1000 APIs.

 SECTION
  III: Good job, right now our application needs to synchronize products,
  pricing of the Agency by using third-party API. 
 1. Write sequence diagram
  to build a solution to save, merge products data from third-party API to our
  database. (Third-party API data change every hour)
 2. What's the strong
  and weak point of your solution? How to improve that?
 
 SECTION IV:
 1.
  Write an architecture diagram to build a solution adapt the list of features
  below.
 + Ensure isolating development and production data. (Don't merge
  data together)
 + Apply Gitlab CI or Github Action to test, build and
  deploy to Heroku automatically.
